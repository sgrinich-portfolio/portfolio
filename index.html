					BeatBeacon is an iPad application I developed for the Carleton College Psychology Department. I worked closely with faculty
					and students to design an app curated to their research needs and to overcome limitations of existing software in the
					app store. BeatBeacon is currently being used to collect data for research to be published in the summer of 2017.
					The following is a description of the research.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Background Information</strong></p>
				<p>"Alcohol use disorder frequently co-occurs with panic disorder. One theory that has received preliminary empirical support
					to explain this relationship is that some individuals self-medicate their panic disorder with alcohol (Abrams, Kushner,
					Lisdahl, & Voight, 2002). However, what remains less clear is why alcohol consumption decreases the likelihood of a
					panic attack.</p>
				<p>One possibility is that alcohol decreases cardioceptive awareness (accuracy of heartbeat perception) and does so especially
					for individuals high in anxiety sensitivity (i.e,. individuals who fear internal bodily sensations). In other words,
					individuals with PD may catastrophically misinterpret physiological sensations (e.g., perceiving a rapid heart rate
					as indicative of an imminent heart attack), and alcohol may decrease conscious awareness of such sensations.</p>
				<p>Individuals with high interoceptive sensitivity are likely to immediately notice changes in arousal-related sensations
					such as increased heart rate. Additionally, people who are both interoceptively sensitive and have high anxiety sensitivity
					are more likely than those with low anxiety sensitivity to interpret such arousal-related sensations as threatening.
					Finally, those who experience un-cued panic attacks, the hallmark symptom of PD, are more interoceptively accurate when
					monitoring their own heart rate than controls and also tend to have higher anxiety sensitivity."</p>

				<p><strong>Current Study</strong></p>
				<p>"The current study seeks to test a possible mechanism for how acute alcohol consumption may decrease the likelihood of
					a panic attack. We predict that alcohol consumption will lower interoceptive sensitivity (specifically, the accuracy
					of heartbeat perception) and will do so especially for individuals high in anxiety sensitivity. We are also examining
					whether alcohol differentially affects heartbeat perception when heart rates are at resting vs. elevated levels. </p>
				<p>Participants will come to the lab on two separate days spaced approximately seven days apart. We intend to run groups
					of 5-6 participants at a time. On one day, participants will be given alcoholic drinks targeting a BAC of .05% and,
					on the other day, alcoholic drinks targeting a BAC of .005%.</p>
				<p>On both testing days, participants will engage in a heartbeat perception task on three occasions: at baseline, after
					an alcohol absorption period, and following a brief period of cardiovascular exercise. For each occasion participants
					will be asked to count all of the heartbeats they feel in each of four fixed time intervals (which could range from
					10-90 seconds). During these intervals, the heart rate monitors will transmit actual heart rate data to an iPad via
					Bluetooth. The data will then be interpreted and organized by the BeatBeacon app, so that we can later compare estimates
					to the actual number of heartbeats."</p>
