				SwimFit is a current side project of mine. It is an iPhone and Apple Watch application that will provide users with a personalized swimming workout plan for both the casual and compeitive swimmer. With over 10 years of experience as a competitive swimmer and as a national competitor I aim to combine my enthusiasm for the sport of swimming and mobile application development to create the greatest wearable experience for a swimmer. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The application itself is still in its prototype stage. I've reached my initial goal to create a minimal viable product of a simple application where I can choose a swimming workout on my iPhone, then jump in the pool with my Apple Watch and have my workout easily accessible on my wrist.

				BeatBeacon is an iPad application I developed for the Carleton College Psychology Department. I worked closely with faculty and students to design an app curated to their research needs and to overcome limitations of existing software in the app store. BeatBeacon is currently being used to collect data for a research to be published in the summer of 2017. The following is a description of the research.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Background Information</strong></p>
				<p>"Alcohol use disorder frequently co-occurs with panic disorder. One theory that has received preliminary empirical support to explain this relationship is that some individuals self-medicate their panic disorder with alcohol (Abrams, Kushner, Lisdahl, & Voight, 2002). However, what remains less clear is why alcohol consumption decreases the likelihood of a panic attack.</p>
				<p>One possibility is that alcohol decreases cardioceptive awareness (accuracy of heartbeat perception) and does so especially for individuals high in anxiety sensitivity (i.e,. individuals who fear internal bodily sensations). In other words, individuals with PD may catastrophically misinterpret physiological sensations (e.g., perceiving a rapid heart rate as indicative of an imminent heart attack), and alcohol may decrease conscious awareness of such sensations.</p>
				<p>Individuals with high interoceptive sensitivity are likely to immediately notice changes in arousal-related sensations such as increased heart rate. Additionally, people who are both interoceptively sensitive and have high anxiety sensitivity are more likely than those with low anxiety sensitivity to interpret such arousal-related sensations as threatening. Finally, those who experience un-cued panic attacks, the hallmark symptom of PD, are more interoceptively accurate when monitoring their own heart rate than controls and also tend to have higher anxiety sensitivity."</p>

				<p><strong>Current Study</strong></p>
				<p>"The current study seeks to test a possible mechanism for how acute alcohol consumption may decrease the likelihood of a panic attack. We predict that alcohol consumption will lower interoceptive sensitivity (specifically, the accuracy of heartbeat perception) and will do so especially for individuals high in anxiety sensitivity. We are also examining whether alcohol differentially affects heartbeat perception when heart rates are at resting vs. elevated levels. </p>
				<p>Participants will come to the lab on two separate days spaced approximately seven days apart. We intend to run groups of 5-6 participants at a time. On one day, participants will be given alcoholic drinks targeting a BAC of .05% and, on the other day, alcoholic drinks targeting a BAC of .005%.</p>
				<p>On both testing days, participants will engage in a heartbeat perception task on three occasions: at baseline, after an alcohol absorption period, and following a brief period of cardiovascular exercise. For each occasion participants will be asked to count all of the heartbeats they feel in each of four fixed time intervals (which could range from 10-90 seconds). During these intervals, the heart rate monitors will transmit actual heart rate data to an iPad via Bluetooth. The data will then be interpreted and organized by the BeatBeacon app, so that we can later compare estimates to the actual number of heartbeats."</p>
